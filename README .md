# Human Pose Estimation using Python

This project implements human pose estimation using OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module with pre-trained Caffe models. The system detects key body joints from an input image and visualizes skeletal connections, making it useful for applications in healthcare, sports analytics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

## Features:

✅ Detects and identifies key human joints from an image.

✅ Uses pre-trained Caffe models for efficient processing.


✅ Supports COCO and MPI datasets for flexible pose estimation.


✅ Visualizes the estimated skeletal structure on the image.


✅ Threshold-based confidence filtering for accurate predictions.


✅ Displays and saves results for further analysis.


✅ Lightweight and runs on standard computing hardware.
